# Pokemon GameService Tracker 
* Summary: Our application will allow the user to track/add game statisics of a pokemon game. The user will have the ability to modify gyms, locations, characters, etc; anything that is within our SQL constraints outlined in Milestone 2 (attached in our repo).  With the ability to customize their own Pokemon games, users will be able to tailor their game experiences according to their preferences. The tech stack of the project will include the usage of Oracle DBMS, JavaScript, and React.js.
